## **Manual Testing**

I started this project by setting everything up and deploying it right away. While developing new features, I tested them on the local version. After finishing and pushing features or parts of them, I tested them on the deployed project.

I always tested new input by entering incorrect information and trying to break it. This way I ensured correct error handling and feedback to the user.

I regularly tested the application in different browsers and devices, like my phone and tablet. When I found a bug while testing on my phone, I created a **Bug Issue** on my Kanban board and provided details and screenshots. After finishing all my *must have* user stories for the MVP, I did a first big round of testing.

The *#peer-code-review* channel on Code InstituteÂ´s Slack was used to get some feedback from other students. I also sent the link to my project to friends and family asking them to test it.

I tested to a minimum screen width of **300px** and a maximum screen width of **3440px** with my monitor. To test **Safari** and **iOS devices** I used [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/).

### **iPhone Testing**

While testing on BrowserStack, I noticed that cookies are not set on some iPhones and also when using an incognito browser. I spent some time reviewing the issue and then used tutor support. 

There I got the information, that this is a known issue and can be solved by allowing *third-party cookies* in the browser settings. The issue is described [here](https://code-institute-room.slack.com/archives/C02MTH5MBDG/p1659719243446449?thread_ts=1659705919.570999&cid=C02MTH5MBDG). As it is a known issue described by Code Institute, I decided to mark the bug as resolved for me. And continue testing with the needed browser settings.

## **Accessibility Testing**

I tested my application using the [WAVE tool](https://wave.webaim.org/) to ensure good accessibility. It returned no errors for all pages of the application.

The returned alerts are because of *redundant alternative text* and *redundant links*. That is the case, because all posts include the profile picture and link to the profile and these are the same if multiple posts are shown from the same profile.

## **Validation**

### **HTML Validation**

I used the [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to validate my HTML code. However, that only valdiates the content of the *index.html* file. As the rest of the application is generated dynamically by React.

Therefore, I also validated the **JSX code** to ensure valid HTML.

### **CSS Validation**

I used the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to validate my custom CSS code, the CSS created by Bootstrap was not tested. My custom CSS code was validated without errors.

### **JavaScript and JSX Validation**

[ESlint](https://eslint.org/) was used in my code editor to test my JavaScript and JSX code. 

On the first run I got quite a few errors. However, most of them where because of missing prop-types. After defining them and fixing some other smaller issues, I have **no errors or warnings**.

The pretty-printed JSON result can be found [here](/docs/testing/eslint-results.pdf).
