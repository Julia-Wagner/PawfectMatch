# **Planning**

I structured my planning phase using the 5 UX planes - strategy, scope, structure, skeleton, and surface. The planning process was iterative. While gaining a better understanding of the project's scope, these planes evolved, creating a user-centered design for PawfectMatch.

## **Strategy Plane**

The idea for my PP5 is to create a platform to match shelter dogs with loving homes. Users can register as a shelter or adopter and find each other using filters.

### **Target Audience**

There are two target groups for this project with different needs and goals.

1. **Dog shelters** that want to use the application to find new homes for their dogs.
   - Shelters that want to reach more people and present themselves.
   - Shelters that want to have a point of reference for everyone interested in their dogs and adoption stories.
   - Shelters that want to find adopters based on the characteristics and needs of each dog.
2. **Individuals and families** that want to adopt a dog or are simply interested in dogs.
   - Adopters that are looking for a dog to adopt.
   - Adopters that want to have a closer look at a specific shelter before adopting a dog from them.
   - Dog lovers that are interested in the shelters work.
   - Dog lovers that want to read heartwarming stories about adopted dogs.

### **Site Goals**

- Build a platform for dog lovers.
- Connect shelters and adopters.
- Improve the adoption process by allowing to define criteria for each side.
  - Shelters can define the characteristics and needs for each dog.
  - Adopters give information about their housing situation and can look for dogs based on filters.
- Allow creating posts with multiple photos.
- Implement CRUD functionality.
- Make the application responsive, so it can be used on desktop, tablet and mobile screen sizes.

## **Scope Plane**

To get a better understanding of what the application will look like, I wrote down the features and sorted them into necessary and nice-to-have features.

### **Necessary Features:**

- Shelters can register and login. 
- Adopters can register and login. 
- Users (shelters and adopters) can fill out a profile. 
- Profiles can be edited. 
- Posts with pictures can be created, edited and deleted. 
- Posts for dogs get a special flag, to be able to filter for dogs. 
- Adopters can search and filter for dogs using characteristics and location. 
- Shelters can define characteristics for each dog. (breed, age, size,â€¦)
- Dogs can be marked as adopted.

### **Nice-to-have Features:**

- Profiles can be deactivated/deleted. 
- Users can follow each other. 
- Have a match functionality where dogs are suggested to adopters based on filtering. 
- Comments for all user profiles.
- Messaging/chat with notifications.

## **Structure Plane**

From the features defined above I was able to create epics and break these down into user stories.

### **Epic: User Authentication**

### **Database Schema**

After defining the needed features for the application, I started creating my database schema.

## **Surface Plane**

### **Design**

My [PP2](https://github.com/Julia-Wagner/tails-and-treats) was also dog-themed and I really liked the colors and images I used there. So I decided to create a similar color scheme and use some of the icons and images again for this project.

### **Colors and Fonts**

I adapted the colors a little bit to have more possible color combinations with high enough contrast. I used [contrast-grid.eightshapes.com](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23F1F1F2%0D%0A%23312A28%0D%0A%23EEE6D9%0D%0A%2354443A%0D%0A%230D546F%0D%0A%23FF6431%0D%0A%239CC63B%0D%0A%23F7BF3D%0D%0A%23FFA06E%0D%0A%236DCBEC%0D%0A&es-color-form__tile-size=regular&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp) to check the contrast and possible color combinations.

![Color contrast](docs/screenshots/color_contrast.png)\
*Accessibility/contrast check for color scheme*

I will use the same fonts for this project as I used for my second project. **Shrikhand** for headings and **Montserrat** for text. The fonts pair nicely and the bold and playful shape of Shrikhand works good with my colors and the theme of the application.

### **Logo**

I created a logo for **PawfectMatch** using the paw print of my dog and the heading font.
