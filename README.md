# **PawfectMatch**

PawfectMatch is a platform designed to connect dog shelters with prospective dog owners. Shelters can register, post details about their dogs, and share stories and photos, while future dog owners can register and search for their perfect match.

# **Planning**

I structured my planning phase using the 5 UX planes - strategy, scope, structure, skeleton, and surface. The planning process was iterative. While gaining a better understanding of the project's scope, these planes evolved, creating a user-centered design for PawfectMatch.

## **Strategy Plane**

The idea for my PP5 is to create a platform to match shelter dogs with loving homes. Users can register as a shelter or adopter and find each other using filters.

### **Target Audience**

There are two target groups for this project with different needs and goals.

1. **Dog shelters** that want to use the application to find new homes for their dogs.
    - Shelters that want to reach more people and present themselves.
    - Shelters that want to have a point of reference for everyone interested in their dogs and adoption stories.
    - Shelters that want to find adopters based on the characteristics and needs of each dog.
2. **Individuals and families** that want to adopt a dog or are simply interested in dogs.
    - Adopters that are looking for a dog to adopt.
    - Adopters that want to have a closer look at a specific shelter before adopting a dog from them.
    - Dog lovers that are interested in the shelters work.
    - Dog lovers that want to read heartwarming stories about adopted dogs.

### **Site Goals**

- Build a platform for dog lovers.
- Connect shelters and adopters.
- Improve the adoption process by allowing to define criteria for each side.
    - Shelters can define the characteristics and needs for each dog.
    - Adopters give information about their housing situation and can look for dogs based on filters.
- Allow creating posts with multiple photos.
- Implement CRUD functionality.
- Make the application responsive, so it can be used on desktop, tablet and mobile screen sizes.

## **Scope Plane**

To get a better understanding of what the application will look like, I wrote down the features and sorted them into necessary and nice-to-have features.

### **Necessary Features:**

- Shelters can register and login.
- Adopters can register and login.
- Users (shelters and adopters) can fill out a profile.
- Profiles can be edited.
- Posts with pictures can be created, edited and deleted.
- Posts for dogs get a special flag, to be able to filter for dogs.
- Adopters can search and filter for dogs using characteristics and location.
- Shelters can define characteristics for each dog. (breed, age, size,â€¦)
- Dogs can be marked as adopted.

### **Nice-to-have Features:**

- Profiles can be deactivated/deleted.
- Users can follow each other.
- Have a match functionality where dogs are suggested to adopters based on filtering.
- Comments for all user profiles.
- Messaging/chat with notifications.

## **Structure Plane**

From the features defined above I was able to create epics and break these down into user stories.

### **Epic: User Authentication**

## **Skeleton Plane**

### **Wireframes**

I created wireframes for desktop and mobile screens for each of the main parts of the application.

### **Database Schema**

After defining the needed features for the application, I started creating my database schema. A detailed description of it and the final ERD for the finished API can be found in the [readme of the PawfectMatch API](https://github.com/Julia-Wagner/PawfectMatch-API?tab=readme-ov-file#database-schema).

![Database Schema](docs/screenshots/database_schema.png)\
*Database Schema for PawfectMatch*

## **Surface Plane**

### **Design**

My [PP2](https://github.com/Julia-Wagner/tails-and-treats) was also dog-themed and I really liked the colors and images I used there. So I decided to create a similar color scheme and use some of the icons and images again for this project.

### **Colors and Fonts**

I adapted the colors a little bit to have more possible color combinations with high enough contrast. I used [contrast-grid.eightshapes.com](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?version=1.1.0&background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23F1F1F2%0D%0A%23312A28%0D%0A%23EEE6D9%0D%0A%2354443A%0D%0A%230D546F%0D%0A%23FF6431%0D%0A%239CC63B%0D%0A%23F7BF3D%0D%0A%23FFA06E%0D%0A%236DCBEC%0D%0A&es-color-form__tile-size=regular&es-color-form__show-contrast=aaa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa&es-color-form__show-contrast=aa18&es-color-form__show-contrast=dnp) to check the contrast and possible color combinations.

![Color contrast](docs/screenshots/color_contrast.png)\
*Accessibility/contrast check for color scheme*

I will use the same fonts for this project as I used for my second project. **Shrikhand** for headings and **Montserrat** for text. The fonts pair nicely and the bold and playful shape of Shrikhand works good with my colors and the theme of the application.

### **Logo**

I created a logo for **PawfectMatch** using the paw print of my dog and the heading font.

![Logo](docs/screenshots/logo.png)\
*PawfectMatch Logo*

# **Agile Process**
I used a [GitHub Projects Board](https://github.com/users/Julia-Wagner/projects/4) to plan and document my work. The details of my agile approach can be found in the separate [AGILE.md file](AGILE.md).

# **Features**

## **User registration and login**

Users can register at **PawfectMatch** by filling out the *sign-up form*. A profile is automatically created for the user after registration. If a user selects the **Register as shelter** button, the profile gets the *type shelter*.

To use **PawfectMatch** as a live platform, a further step would be added to the registration to check if the user really is a shelter. This way I can avoid private breeders or people with bad intentions pretending to be a shelter. However, for this project, there will be no real shelters, so I added a simple button to be able to register as both profile types easily.

![Registration desktop](docs/screenshots/registration_desktop.png)\

![Registration phone](docs/screenshots/registration_phone.png)\

After successful registration, the user gets redirected to the *sign-in form*. If incorrect information is sent, error messages are shown in the forms.

![Login error desktop](docs/screenshots/login_error_desktop.png)\
*Login with error on a desktop*

## **Feed**

After successfully logging in, the users are redirected to the *feed*. This page is also available for unauthorized users. It shows all posts sorted by newest to oldest. Ten posts are loaded, if the user scrolls to the bottom of the page and there are more than ten posts, the next ten are loaded.

For each post, the profile that created the post is shown with the profile image and username. Logged-in users can follow and unfollow the profile or save and unsave the post. The content of the post is clipped after three lines and a link to view the full post is shown.

![Feed unauthorized desktop](docs/screenshots/feed_unauthorized_desktop.png)\
*Feed for an unauthorized user on a desktop*

![Feed phone](docs/screenshots/feed_phone.png)\

## **Following**

The *Following* page is shown only for logged-in users. It renders posts like the feed, but only from profiles the user follows.

![Following](docs/screenshots/following.png)\
*Following page on a desktop*

## **Post CRUD**

Full CRUD functionality is implemented for posts. Logged-in shelter users can create posts and add a title, content and image to it. Dogs that are created by the logged-in shelter can also be linked to a post. 

For the content, I installed a WYSIWYG editor to allow more styling of the post. I installed the package *dompurify* to render the content safely and avoid security risks.

![Create post](docs/screenshots/post_create_desktop.png)\
*Create a post on a desktop*

The owner of a post can edit or delete the post. For deletion, I added a confirm window to avoid unintentional deletion. 

![Update post](docs/screenshots/post_update_phone.png)\
*Update a post on a phone*

![Delete post](docs/screenshots/post_delete_desktop.png)\
*Delete a post on a desktop*

The detail page of a post contains the whole content. If there are dogs linked to the post, they are shown underneath the content of the post.

![Detail post](docs/screenshots/post_detail.png)\
*Post detail page*

## **Profile**

A profile is automatically created for a user after registration. User profiles can be viewed by everyone, but only the owner of a profile can edit it. The profile detail page contains all details added by the user. Users can follow and unfollow other profiles. If the owner of the profile added a name, it is shown at the top of the profile. If not, the username is visible there.

![Profile](docs/screenshots/profile_phone.png)\
*Profile detail page on a phone*

A link to all created posts is added if the user is a shelter. 

### **Comments**

Comments can be added to profiles and are shown at the bottom of the profile page.

![Profile shelter](docs/screenshots/profile_shelter.png)\
*Profile detail page of a shelter*

A comment can be edited or deleted by the person who created it.

![Edit comment](docs/screenshots/comment_edit.png)\
*Edit a comment on a phone*

Banned words can be defined in the admin panel. Comments are checked before posting them to ensure they do not contain a banned word.

![Banned comment](docs/screenshots/banned_comment.png)\

### **Edit profile**

Each user can change their name, description, country and profile image. Only shelters are allowed to add an exact address, phone number and mail address.

![Profile edit shelter](docs/screenshots/profile_edit_shelter_desktop.png)\
*Profile edit shelter on a desktop*

![Profile edit adopter](docs/screenshots/profile_edit_adopter_phone.png)\

## **Dogs**

Only shelters can create dogs. They have a link in the navbar that takes them to the *Dogs* page. There all dogs that the logged-in shelter created are shown and they see a button to create a new dog.

![Dogs page](docs/screenshots/dogs_page.png)\
*Dogs page on a desktop*

To create a dog, the name, breed, birthday, size and gender of the dog have to be added. Additionally, a description can be added using the WYSIWYG editor and characteristics can be chosen for the dog. A main image, a video and additional images can be uploaded for dogs.

![Create a dog](docs/screenshots/create_dog.png)\
*Create a do on a desktop*

The detail page of a dog includes the main image, name and description of the dog. Additional information and characteristics of the dog are rendered using icons and colorful tags. If additional images have been uploaded, they are shown in a slideshow. If a video was uploaded, it is shown under the slideshow.

At the bottom of the dog detail page, the contact information of the shelter and posts where this dog is linked are shown.

### **Matches**

Adopters do not see the *Dogs* page, instead they have the *Matches* page. This page includes all dogs that are available for adoption. On top of the page, there is a filter to filter the matches by size, gender or characteristics of the dog.

The results load immediately after changing the filter. The button *Reset all filters* closes the filter and shows all dogs again.

![Matches page](docs/screenshots/matches_filter.png)\
*Matches page with filter on a desktop*

## **Saved Posts and Recent Adoptions**

Posts can be saved and unsaved. On bigger screens, the five most recently saved posts are listed and linked in the sidebar. There is also a link to a separate page with all saved posts. For mobile screens, the saved posts can be found on this separate page.

![Saved posts desktop](docs/screenshots/feed_sticky_sidebar.png)\
*Saved posts on a desktop*

The number of saved posts is shown at the top of the page. The page as well as the sidebar reload when saving or unsaving a post, so they are always up-to-date.

![Saved posts phone](docs/screenshots/saves_phone.png)\
*Saved posts on a phone*

Recently adopted dogs are also shown in the sticky sidebar on bigger screens and on an additional page for smaller screens. The page includes all dogs that are marked as adopted.

## **About Page**

When clicking the logo in the navbar, the user is redirected to the about page. This includes information about **PawfectMatch** and contact details.

![About page](docs/screenshots/about_page.png)\
*About page*

## **Not found Page**

If a page that does not exist is opened, the *Not found page* is shown.

# **Future Enhancements**

After extensive testing and getting feedback from testers, I can say that the project is ready to be used as a real-world application.

I have some user stories left that I marked as *wonÂ´t have* for the first release of the project. These might be implemented for future releases as enhancements of the application. The future features are:
  
  - **Deactivating a profile** - Users can deactivate and hide their profiles. They can reactivate it any time to be shown in the application again.
  - **Notifications** - Users get notifications and can mark these as read.
  - **Chat** - Create an in-app chat for adopters to chat with shelters.

Another user story I marked as *wonÂ´t have* is defining adoption requirements for a dog. I decided to drop this completely and not plan it for future versions either. The reason for this is that while developing and testing the application, I started to think that it would be too complicated for users to add additional requirements. For many dogs these would not be necessary and if there are special requirements they can be added manually to the description of the dog and be discussed directly between the shelter and possible adopters.

# **Testing**

Please refer to the separate [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

# **Deployment**

Here is the [link to the deployed project](https://pawfectmatch-60f883124db2.herokuapp.com/). The deployment process for the API can be found [here](https://github.com/Julia-Wagner/PawfectMatch-API?tab=readme-ov-file#deployment).
