## **Methodology**

I used an agile approach to plan and work on my project. I decided to create one [GitHub projects board](https://github.com/users/Julia-Wagner/projects/4) that I use for both frontend and backend tasks. This way I have an overview of all user stories and can manage sprints and milestones for the whole project in one place.

I decided to group my features into **Epics** and create several **User Stories** for each epic. To prioritize the stories, I used **MoSCoW Prioritization**. To represent this in my Kanban board I created custom labels (*must have*, *should have*, *could have* and *wonÂ´t have*).

To have a better overview of issues on my board, I also created custom labels for the type of issue and for Story Points using the Fibonacci sequence.

I added all my user stories with the according epic, acceptance criteria and tasks in the description. I used **milestones** from the beginning to plan a MVP release and a final submission. I decided to start by putting all my user stories in the **Backlog** column of my board. To visualize my sprints, I will use milestones. At the beginning of each sprint, I will add the according issues to the current sprint milestone and move them to the **Todo** column.

## **Sprints**

Below is a summary of each of my sprints. As described above, I am using milestones for sprints. To focus on the tasks of my current sprint, I am using a filter for the current milestone to only see the issues added to my current sprint.

### **Sprint 1 (23.03. - 29.03.)**

For my first sprint, I added a backend dev task, to set up the project. Additionally, I added three backend user stories with a total of **14 story points**.

I finished all the tasks planned for my first sprint. I also decided to deploy the API right away to Heroku, so I added an additional dev task for this.

### **Sprint 2 (30.03. - 05.04.)**

I added four user stories with a total of **21 story points** for my second sprint. I have two *must have* and two *could have* user stories. As I am not sure yet how difficult it will be to create the dog posts and if I will still have time for the comments in this sprint.

I only finished one of the planned user stories for this sprint. I started the second *must have* story, but did not finish it completely as it was more complex than I originally thought. I will move all unfinished user stories to the backlog.

### **Sprint 3 (06.04. - 12.04.)**

I decided to add the unfinished user stories from the last sprint with a total of **13 story points** for my next sprint.

I finished all planned user stories and added one *dev task* at the end as I still had time. I decided to create automated tests for all my existing apps. It was a good idea to do this early, as I found a few issues with the permissions with the automated tests.

*End of Sprint 3*

### **Sprint 4 (13.04. - 19.04.)**

For this sprint I added five user stories with a total of **16 story points**. I have two *new* user stories to implement and three stories that should already be covered by the existing functionality. These just need to be tested to make sure the acceptance criteria is met, so I just gave them one story point each.
