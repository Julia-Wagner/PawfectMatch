## **Methodology**

I used an agile approach to plan and work on my project. I decided to create one [GitHub projects board](https://github.com/users/Julia-Wagner/projects/4) that I use for both frontend and backend tasks. This way I have an overview of all user stories and can manage sprints and milestones for the whole project at one place.

I decided to group my features into **Epics** and create several **User Stories** for each epic. To prioritize the stories, I used **MoSCoW Prioritization**. To represent this in my Kanban board I created custom labels (*must have*, *should have*, *could have* and *wonÂ´t have*).

To have a better overview of issues on my board, I also created custom labels for the type of issue and for Story Points using the Fibonacci sequence.

I added all my user stories with the according epic, acceptance criteria and tasks in the description. I used **milestones** from the beginning to plan a MVP release and a final submission. I decided to start by putting all my user stories in the **Backlog** column of my board. To visualize my sprints, I will use milestones. At the beginning of each sprint, I will add the according issues to the current sprint milestone and move them to the **Todo** column.

## **Sprints**

Below is a summary of each of my sprints. As described above, I am using milestones for sprints. To focus on the tasks of my current sprint, I am using a filter for the current milestone to only see the issues added to my current sprint.
